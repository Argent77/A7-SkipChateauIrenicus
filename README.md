# Skip Chateau Irenicus
*A BG2:EE mod that allows you to skip the opening dungeon without losing potential equipment and items.*

## Overview

Are you tired of running through the whole initial dungeon over and over? Not anymore!

This mod allows you skip all the boring details of Irenicus' dungeon. You can even collect the items normally found within the dungeon. Just inspect the rubble of the destroyed building on Waukeen's Promenade. As a bonus you will also get some experience and may find a bit of pocket change.

"Skip Chateau Irenicus" is meant as an alternative to the (in)famous Dungeon-Be-Gone mod which provides a similar option, but in a way that seriously breaks the fourth wall.

This mod requires BG2:EE patched to v2.0 or higher, or EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy).

## Components

There is only one component: *"Skip Chateau Irenicus".*

The component triggers moments after you are released from your cell. A rogue appears and opens up the opportunity 
to use the magical portals to leave the dungeon. Each portal will transport you to the next level of the dungeon.
The teleporter on the second level allows you to transport directly to the surface.
Afterwards the way back is blocked like in the unmodified game. To loot the items from the dungeon inspect the rubble 
of the destroyed building on Waukeen's Promenade.

The item description of the dryads' acorns have been slightly altered to give you some information what you can do 
with it.

**Note:** There may be a general slowdown of the game for a few seconds after the initial cutscene on Waukeen's Promenade which is caused by the item transference process.

## Compatibility

This mod skips an important part of the SoA main story. Although items will be transferred to the surface you may still miss certain mod-added content, such as journal entries or NPCs. There is currently no technically feasible way to automatically collect all available NPCs.

The mod is designed so that you can transport back and forth between the two levels of Chateau Irenicus until you decide to transport to the surface. Afterwards the way is blocked forever, like in the unmodified game.
