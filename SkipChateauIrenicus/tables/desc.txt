Item control tables
===================

The subfolder "tables" may contain one or more 2DA files which define how items or containers should be handled.
The table can be universally used for three different actions.

1. Which areas should be considered when transferring container items:
The default areas to consider are AR0601, AR0602 and AR0603. However, mods may add more areas to initial dungeon. 
This action can be used to register these areas. It's defined as follows:
ACTION:     ADD_AREA
AREA:       The area code of the map.

2. Which containers should be excluded from the item transfer process:
Some containers may be used internally without being accessed by the party. These containers can be ignored by the 
item transfer process. For example, EET uses such a container. It's defined as follows:
ACTION:     SKIP_CONTAINER
AREA:       The area code where the container can be found.
CONTAINER:  The container name. Spaces in container names must be removed completely.

3. Which items should be destroyed after leaving Chateau Irenicus:
Some items are only useful in Chateau Irenicus. These items can be destroyed after leaving the dungeon. You can also 
specify whether to destroy them only in party inventory. You have to define these entries multiple times if you want 
to destroy more than one instance of the same item or stack. It's defined as follows:
ACTION:     DESTROY_ITEM
AREA:       The area code where the item can be acquired.
ITEMNAME:   The item's resource name without extension.
INV_ONLY:   Set to 0 if the item should be destroyed in both container and party inventory.
            Set to 1 if the item should only be destroyed in party inventory.

4. Which items should be manually created after leaving Irenicus:
Some items are acquired by other means, like quest rewards or scripted events. These items are not transferred 
automatically. You can define which item to create manually after leaving the dungeon. You can also specify whether 
the item has to be unique. It's defined as follows:
ACTION:     CREATE_ITEM
AREA:       The area code where the item could be acquired normally.
ITEMNAME:   The item's resource name without extension.
UNIQUE:     Set to 0 if multiple instance of the item are allowed.
            Set to 1 if only a single instance of the item is allowed.
CHARGE1:    Defines the number of stackable items or primary charges.
CHARGE2:    Defines the number of secondary charges.
CHARGE3:    Defines the number of tertiary charges.


Example 2DA entries for each action:
                AREA      CONTAINER/ITEMNAME  UNIQUE/INV_ONLY CHARGE1 CHARGE2 CHARGE3
ADD_AREA        X#0001    *                   0               0       0       0
SKIP_CONTAINER  AR0602    K#ImportContainer   0               0       0       0
DESTROY_ITEM    AR0602    MISC4I              1               0       0       0
CREATE_ITEM     AR0602    AROW01              0               20      0       0

Important: All columns must be filled with data, even for actions which require fewer parameters.


Example TP2 code from an imaginary mod:
ACTION_IF (DIRECTORY_EXISTS ~SkipChateauIrenicus/tables~) BEGIN
  COPY ~AnImaginaryMod/skiptables/my_table1.2da~ ~SkipChateauIrenicus/tables~
END
